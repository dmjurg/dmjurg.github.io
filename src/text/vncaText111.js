    title: `§ 13.1-898.2. Domestication.`,
    text: [
      `A. A foreign corporation may become a domestic corporation if the laws of the jurisdiction in which the foreign corporation is incorporated authorize it to domesticate in another jurisdiction. The laws of the Commonwealth shall govern the effect of domesticating in the Commonwealth pursuant to this article.
     B. A domestic corporation not required by law to be a domestic corporation may become a foreign corporation if the jurisdiction in which the corporation intends to domesticate allows for the domestication. Regardless of whether the laws of the foreign jurisdiction require the adoption of a plan of domestication, the domestication shall be approved in the manner provided in this article. The laws of the jurisdiction in which the corporation domesticates shall govern the effect of domesticating in that jurisdiction.
     C. The plan of domestication shall set forth:
     1. A statement of the jurisdiction in which the corporation is to be domesticated;
     2. The terms and conditions of the domestication; and
     3. For a foreign corporation that is to become a domestic corporation, as a referenced attachment, amended and restated articles of incorporation that comply with the requirements of § 13.1-819 as they will be in effect upon consummation of the domestication.
     D. The plan of domestication may include any other provision relating to the domestication.
     E. The plan of domestication may also include a provision that the board of directors may amend the plan at any time prior to issuance of the certificate of domestication or such other document required by the laws of the other jurisdiction to consummate the domestication. Where a plan of domestication is required to be submitted to the members for their approval, an amendment made subsequent to the submission of the plan to the members of the corporation shall not alter or change any of the terms or conditions of the plan if such alteration or change would adversely affect the members of any class of the corporation.

      `A. When the members of a domestic corporation have voting rights, a plan of domestication shall be adopted in the following manner:
     1. The board of directors of the corporation shall adopt the plan of domestication.
     2. After adopting a plan of domestication, the board of directors shall submit the plan of domestication for approval by the members.
     3. For a plan of domestication to be approved:
     a. The board of directors shall recommend the plan to the members unless the board of directors determines that because of conflict of interests or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation and communicates the basis for its determination to the members with the plan; and
     b. The members shall approve the plan as provided in subdivision 6 of this subsection.
     4. The board of directors may condition its submission of the plan of domestication to the members on any basis.
     5. The corporation shall notify each member entitled to vote of the proposed members' meeting in accordance with § 13.1-842 at which the plan of domestication is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that a purpose of the meeting is to consider the plan and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy of the plan.
     6. Unless this Act or the board of directors, acting pursuant to subdivision 4 of this subsection, requires a greater vote, the plan of domestication shall be approved by each voting group entitled to vote on the plan by more than two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast by that voting group. The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater or lesser vote than that provided for in this subdivision or a vote by separate voting groups so long as the vote provided for is not less than a majority of all the votes cast on the plan by each voting group entitled to vote on the plan at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists.
     7. Voting by a class of members as a separate voting group is required on a plan of domestication if the plan contains a provision that, if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation, would entitle the class to vote as a separate voting group on the proposed amendment under § 13.1-887.
     B. When a domestic corporation has no members, or no members have voting rights, a plan of domestication shall be adopted at a meeting of the board of directors of such corporation upon receiving the vote of a majority of the directors in office.
