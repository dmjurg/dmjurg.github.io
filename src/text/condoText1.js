        A. This chapter shall apply to all condominiums and to all horizontal property regimes or condominium projects. For the purposes of this chapter, the terms "horizontal property regime" and "condominium project" shall be deemed to correspond to the term "condominium"; the term "apartment" shall be deemed to correspond to the term "unit"; the term "co-owner" shall be deemed to correspond to the term "unit owner"; the term "council of co-owners" shall be deemed to correspond to the term "unit owners' association"; the term "developer" shall be deemed to correspond to the term "declarant"; the term "general common elements" shall be deemed to correspond to the term "common elements"; and the terms "master deed" and "master lease" shall be deemed to correspond to the term "declaration" and shall be deemed included in the term "condominium instruments." This chapter shall be deemed to supersede the Horizontal Property Act, §§ 55-79.1 through 55-79.38, and no condominium shall be established under the latter on or after July 1, 1974. But this chapter shall not be construed to affect the validity of any provision of any condominium instrument recorded prior to July 1, 1974. Nor shall Article 4 (§ 55-79.86 et seq.) of this chapter be deemed to supersede §§ 55-79.16 through 55-79.31 of the Horizontal Property Act as to any condominiums established prior to the effective date hereof.

        B. This chapter shall not apply to condominiums located outside the Commonwealth. Sections 55-79.88 through 55-79.94 and §§ 55-79.98 through 55-79.103 shall apply to all contracts for the disposition of condominium units signed in the Commonwealth by any person, unless exempt under § 55-79.87.

        C. Subsection B of § 55-79.79 and § 55-79.94 do not apply to the declarant of a conversion condominium if that declarant is a proprietary lessees' association that, immediately before the creation of the condominium, owned fee simple title to or a fee simple reversionary interest in the real estate described pursuant to subdivision (a) (3) of § 55-79.54.

        1974, c. 416; 1982, c. 545; 1989, c. 63; 2006, c. 646.

        When used in this chapter:

        "Capital components" means those items, whether or not a part of the common elements, for which the unit owners' association has the obligation for repair, replacement or restoration and for which the executive organ determines funding is necessary.

        "Common elements" means all portions of the condominium other than the units.

        "Common expenses" means all expenditures lawfully made or incurred by or on behalf of the unit owners' association, together with all funds lawfully assessed for the creation and/or maintenance of reserves pursuant to the provisions of the condominium instruments.

        "Condominium" means real property, and any incidents thereto or interests therein, lawfully submitted to this chapter by the recordation of condominium instruments pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. No project shall be deemed a condominium within the meaning of this chapter unless the undivided interests in the common elements are vested in the unit owners.

        "Condominium instruments" is a collective term referring to the declaration, bylaws, and plats and plans, recorded pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Any exhibit, schedule, or certification accompanying a condominium instrument and recorded simultaneously therewith shall be deemed an integral part of that condominium instrument. Any amendment or certification of any condominium instrument shall, from the time of the recordation of such amendment or certification, be deemed an integral part of the affected condominium instrument, so long as such amendment or certification was made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

        "Condominium unit" means a unit together with the undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to that unit. (Cf. the definition of unit, infra.).

        "Contractable condominium" means a condominium from which one or more portions of the submitted land may be withdrawn in accordance with the provisions of the declaration and of this chapter. If such withdrawal can occur only by the expiration or termination of one or more leases, then the condominium shall not be deemed a contractable condominium within the meaning of this chapter.

        "Conversion condominium" means a condominium containing structures which before the recording of the declaration, were wholly or partially occupied by persons other than those who have contracted for the purchase of condominium units and those who occupy with the consent of such purchasers.

However, for the purposes of clauses (i) and (iii), the term "declarant" shall not include an institutional lender which acquires title by foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof unless such lender offers to dispose of its interest in a condominium unit not previously disposed of to anyone not in the business of selling real estate for his own account, except as otherwise provided in § 55-79.74:3. The term "declarant" shall not include an individual who acquires title to a condominium unit at a foreclosure sale.

        "Land" is a three-dimensional concept and includes parcels with upper or lower boundaries, or both upper and lower boundaries, as well as parcels extending ab solo usque ad coelum. Parcels of airspace constitute land within the meaning of this chapter. Any requirement in this chapter of a legally sufficient description shall be deemed to include a requirement that the upper or lower boundaries, if any, of the parcel in question be identified with reference to established datum.

Such agreement shall not contain any provision for waiver or any other provision in derogation of the rights of the prospective purchaser as contemplated by this subsection, nor shall any such provision be a part of any ancillary agreement.

        "Offer" means any inducement, solicitation, or attempt to encourage any person or persons to acquire any legal or equitable interest in a condominium unit, except as security for a debt. Nothing shall be considered an "offer" which expressly states that the condominium has not been registered with the Common Interest Community Board and that no unit in the condominium can or will be offered for sale until such time as the condominium has been so registered.

        "Officer" means any member of the executive organ or official of the unit owners' association.

        "Par value" means a number of dollars or points assigned to each unit by the declaration. Substantially identical units shall be assigned the same par value, but units located at substantially different heights above the ground, or having substantially different views, or having substantially different amenities or other characteristics that might result in differences in market value, may, but need not, be considered substantially identical within the meaning of this subsection. If par value is stated in terms of dollars, that statement shall not be deemed to reflect or control the sales price or fair market value of any unit, and no opinion, appraisal, or fair market transaction at a different figure shall affect the par value of any unit, or any undivided interest in the common elements, voting rights in the unit owners' association or liability for common expenses assigned on the basis thereof.

        "Person" means a natural person, corporation, partnership, association, trust, or other entity capable of holding title to real property, or any combination thereof.

        "Purchaser" means any person or persons, other than a declarant, who acquire by means of a voluntary transfer a legal or equitable interest in a condominium unit, other than (i) a leasehold interest, including renewal options, of less than 20 years or (ii) as security for a debt.

        "Settlement agent" means the same as that term is defined in § 55-525.16.

        "Size" means the number of cubic feet, or the number of square feet of ground and/or floor space, within each unit as computed by reference to the plat and plans and rounded off to a whole number. Certain spaces within the units including, without limitation, attic, basement, and/or garage space may, but need not, be omitted from such calculation or partially discounted by the use of a ratio, so long as the same basis of calculation is employed for all units in the condominium, and so long as that basis is described in the declaration.

        "Special declarant rights" means any right reserved for the benefit of a declarant, or of a person or group of persons that becomes a declarant, to (i) expand an expandable condominium, (ii) contract a contractable condominium, (iii) convert convertible land or convertible space or both, (iv) appoint or remove any officers of the unit owners' association or the executive organ pursuant to subsection A of § 55-79.74, (v) exercise any power or responsibility otherwise assigned by any condominium instrument or by this chapter to the unit owners' association, any officer or the executive organ, or (vi) maintain sales offices, management offices, model units and signs pursuant to § 55-79.66.

If there is any unit owner other than the declarant, each unit, together with its common element interest, but excluding its common element interest in convertible land and in any withdrawable land within which the declarant has the right to create units and/or limited common elements shall be separately assessed and taxed. Each convertible land and withdrawable land within which the declarant has the right to create units and/or limited common elements shall be separately assessed and taxed against the declarant.

    text:
      `
        A. No zoning or other land use ordinance shall prohibit condominiums as such by reason of the form of ownership inherent therein. Neither shall any condominium be treated differently by any zoning or other land use ordinance which would permit a physically identical project or development under a different form of ownership. Except as provided in subsection E, no local government may require further review or approval to record condominium instruments when a property has previously complied with subdivision, site plan, zoning, or other applicable land use regulations.

        B. Subdivision and site plan ordinances in any county, city or town in the Commonwealth shall apply to any condominium in the same manner as such ordinances would apply to a physically identical project or development under a different form of ownership; however, the declarant need not apply for or obtain subdivision approval to record condominium instruments if site plan approval for the land being submitted to the condominium has first been obtained.

        C. During development of a condominium containing additional land or withdrawable land, phase lines created by the condominium instruments shall not be considered property lines for purposes of subdivision. If the condominium can no longer be expanded by the addition of additional land, then the owner of the land not part of the condominium shall subdivide such land prior to its conveyance, unless such land is subject to an approved site plan as provided in subsection B of this section, or prior to modification of such approved site plan. In the event of any conveyance of land within phase lines of the condominium, the condominium and any lot created by such conveyance shall be deemed to comply with the local subdivision ordinance, provided such land is subject to an approved site plan.

        D. During the period of declarant control and as long as the declarant has the right to create additional units or to complete the common elements, the declarant has the authority to execute, file, and process any subdivision, site plan, zoning, or other land use applications or disclosures, including conditional zoning proffers and agreements incidental thereto that do not create an affirmative obligation on the unit owners' association without its consent, with respect to the common elements or applications affecting more than one unit, notwithstanding that the declarant is not the owner of the land.

        In accordance with subsection B of § 55-79.80, once the declarant no longer has such authority, the executive organ of the unit owners' association, if any, and if not, then a representative duly appointed by the unit owners' association, shall have the authority to execute, file, and process any subdivision, site plan, zoning, or other land use applications or disclosures, including conditional zoning proffers and agreements incidental thereto that do not create an affirmative obligation on the declarant without its consent, with respect to the common elements or applications affecting more than one unit, notwithstanding that the unit owners' association is not the owner of the land. Such applications shall not adversely affect the rights of the declarant to develop additional land. For purposes of obtaining building and occupancy permits, the unit owner (including the declarant if the declarant is the unit owner) shall apply for permits for the unit, and the unit owners' association shall apply for permits for the common elements, except that the declarant shall apply for permits for convertible land.

        E. Counties, cities and towns may provide by ordinance that proposed conversion condominiums and the use thereof, which do not conform to the zoning, land use and site plan regulations of the respective county or city in which the property is located, shall secure a special use permit, a special exception, or variance, as the case may be, prior to such property becoming a conversion condominium. A request for such a special use permit, special exception, or variance filed on or after July 1, 1982, shall be granted if the applicant can demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the local authority that the nonconformities are not likely to be adversely affected by the proposed conversion. No action on any such request shall be unreasonably delayed. In the event of an approved conversion to condominium ownership, counties, cities, towns, sanitary districts, or other political subdivisions may impose such charges and fees as are lawfully imposed by such political subdivisions as a result of construction of new structures to the extent that such charges and fees, or portions of such charges and fees, imposed upon property subject to such conversions may be reasonably related to greater or additional services provided by the political subdivision as a result of the conversion.

        F. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit application of any provision of the Uniform Statewide Building Code (§ 36-97 et seq.) or any local ordinances regulating design and construction of roads, sewer and water lines, stormwater management facilities and other public infrastructure, to a condominium in a manner different from the manner in which such provision is applied to other buildings of similar physical form and nature of occupancy.

        1974, c. 416; 1975, c. 415; 1982, c. 663; 1991, c. 497; 2006, cc. 9, 317.

    title: `§ 55-79.44. Eminent domain.`,
    text:
      `
        (a) If any portion of the common elements is taken by eminent domain, the award therefor shall be paid to the unit owners' association. Provided, however, that the portion of the award attributable to the taking of any permanently assigned limited common element shall be allocated by the decree to the unit owner of the unit to which that limited common element was so assigned at the time of the taking. If that limited common element was permanently assigned to more than one unit at the time of the taking, then the portion of the award attributable to the taking thereof shall be allocated in equal shares to the unit owners of the units to which it was so assigned or in such other shares as the condominium instruments may specify for this express purpose. A permanently assigned limited common element is a limited common element which cannot be reassigned or which can be reassigned only with the consent of the unit owner or owners of the unit or units to which it is assigned in accordance with § 55-79.57.

        (b) If one or more units is taken by eminent domain, the undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to any such unit shall thenceforth appertain to the remaining units, being allocated to them in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common elements. The court shall enter a decree reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby, and the award shall include, without limitation, just compensation to the unit owner of any unit taken for his undivided interest in the common elements as well as for his unit.

        (c) If portions of any unit are taken by eminent domain, the court shall determine the fair market value of the portions of such unit not taken, and the undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to any such units shall be reduced, in the case of each such unit, in proportion to the diminution in the fair market value of such unit resulting from the taking. The portions of undivided interest in the common elements thereby divested from the unit owners of any such units shall be reallocated among those units and the other units in the condominium in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common elements, with any units partially taken participating in such reallocation on the basis of their undivided interests as reduced in accordance with the preceding sentence. The court shall enter a decree reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby, and the award shall include, without limitation, just compensation to the unit owner of any unit partially taken for that portion of his undivided interest in the common elements divested from him by operation of the first sentence of this subsection and not revested in him by operation of the following sentence, as well as for that portion of his unit taken by eminent domain.

        (d) If, however, the taking of a portion of any unit makes it impractical to use the remaining portion of that unit for any lawful purpose permitted by the condominium instruments, then the entire undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to that unit shall thenceforth appertain to the remaining units, being allocated to them in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common elements, and the remaining portion of that unit shall thenceforth be a common element. The court shall enter a decree reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby, and the award shall include, without limitation, just compensation to the unit owner of such unit for his entire undivided interest in the common elements and for his entire unit.

        (e) Votes in the unit owners' association, rights to future common profits, and liabilities for future common expenses not specially assessed, appertaining to any unit or units taken or partially taken by eminent domain, shall thenceforth appertain to the remaining units, being allocated to them in proportion to their relative voting strength in the unit owners' association, with any units partially taken participating in such reallocation as though their voting strength in the unit owners' association had been reduced in proportion to the reduction in their undivided interests in the common elements, and the decree of the court shall provide accordingly.

        (f) The decree of the court shall require the recordation thereof among the land records of the city or county in which the condominium is located.

        1974, c. 416; 1975, c. 415; 1982, c. 545; 1998, c. 32.
